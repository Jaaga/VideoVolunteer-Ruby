# Methods that are needed for display and id generation.

module Features
  # All columns have '_' for spaces and are lowercase. When the form and display
  # methods are used for various views, they iterate through column names, so
  # while this is being done, name_modifier is used to make titles by removing
  # the underscores and capitalizing each word.
  def name_modifier(x)
    # Uses the column name for the label unless another label is needed. Using
    # this hash to store the custom labels.
